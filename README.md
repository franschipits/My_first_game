# My First Game
Welcome to my first game!
I made this runner game in `Python` with `Pygame`, because I wanted to do something different for my next project. I followed a tutorial on youtube to learn the basics of `Pygame` and be able to create other 2D games in the future.

# How it works
The player needs to use the spacebar to jump the obstacles without colliding with them. The points are how many seconds the player stays alive.
